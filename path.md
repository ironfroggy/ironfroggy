That which I can look back on and that which I can look forward to.

# 2015

- I will release at least 2 games on Android. Maybe 3? Maybe on iOS?
- I will finish my novel draft.
- I will finish the first revision of my novel.
- I will write morning pages every single day the entire year.
- I will actually win NaNoWriMo

# 2014

## December

- I will get a more complete beta of my puzzle game ready with at least 30 levels

### Week 1 Plans

- Organizing this document and the Codex is oddly rewarding

### Later Plans

## November Review

- I build a satisfying prototype for a simple puzzle game that I'm calling Illuminate.
  I'm building it in Unity3D, and it isn't the first game I've begun but it is the first
  game I feel a confidence in finishing.
- I took a holiday break at the end of the month that felt very relaxing.
- I tried to do NaNoWriMo and I didn't fail but I didn't finish. I'm still working on my novel.
- I finished my second month in a row of writing morning pages every day
