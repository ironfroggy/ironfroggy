# Codex Vitae

From Buster Benson at https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md#codex-vitae-1

> This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. And it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression. Our lives are filled with a desire to know the universe, and to be known. To leave a dent. This is just my English-major-y way of representing the dent in the form of a text, because words are pretty great. Maybe one day we'll be able to download our brains onto our credit cards and that would more directly represent our full body of knowledge from life.

## Goals for the Codex

I'm still formulating what I want this to be for me. I also recognize that what I want out of this
codex is going to change over time.

This is a short, incomplete, prone-to-change list of goals for my Codex Vitae.

- A declaration of my political and social positions and explainations for them
- A representation of my conscious approach towards life
- A documentation of the formative influences on my life.

## The Things I Know

## The Things I Believe

## The Things I Feel
